# React Practice Project

Welcome to my React practice project! This repository contains the code for my journey of learning and experimenting with React, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.

## About This Project

This project is a sandbox for me to practice React concepts, try out new ideas, and build small applications. As I'm in the early stages of learning React, the code here may vary in complexity and structure as I explore different aspects of the library.

### What I'm Learning

- **React Basics**: Understanding components, JSX, and state management.
- **Props**: Passing data between components.
- **Event Handling**: Working with user interactions in React.
- **Hooks**: Using React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and side effects.
- **Component Lifecycle**: Learning how components are created, updated, and destroyed.
- **React Router**: Implementing routing in a React application.


Stay with me to see me growing.
