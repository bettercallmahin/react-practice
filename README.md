# React.js Learning Progress

This repository tracks my learning journey as I dive deeper into React.js. Below are the key concepts I've covered and the projects I've built along the way.

## Day 1: 23/9/24

### Inline CSS
- **Create an Object**: Learned to define a style object in JavaScript.
- **Add Object as Style**: Applied the created object as an inline style to HTML tags.
- **Directly Add Style**: Used inline styles directly within JSX using curly braces.

### CSS Stylesheet
- **Step 1**: Linked the stylesheet in `index.html`.
- **Step 2**: Used `className` to add styles to elements.

### Create `index.css` in `src`
- **Step 1**: Created `index.css` in the `src` folder.
- **Step 2**: Imported the stylesheet using:
  ```javascript
  import './index.css';
  ```

## Day 2: 25/9/24

### Components
- **Adding Classes**: Used `className` to style components.
- **Naming Convention**: Followed the convention of capitalizing the first letter of component names.
- **Component Creation**: 
  - Created components internally in `index.js`.
  - Created external components in the `src` folder (`Card.js`).
- **Import/Export**: 
  - Exported components from `Card.js`.
  - Imported them into `index.js`.

## Day 3: 30/9/24

### Props
- **Props**: Passed data using props to make components reusable. 

## Destruction
- Destructuring in React allows you to extract properties from the props object directly into variables, making your code cleaner and more readable. Instead of repeatedly using props to access each property, you can destructure them at the beginning of your component.

##Creating Data in JSON
- create a json object
